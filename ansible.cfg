# ==============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

timeout = 30

# Leaving off ControlPersist will result in poor performance, so use
# paramiko on older platforms rather than removing it
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=30m

# Enabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to
# execute a module on the remote server. This can result in a significant
# performance improvement when enabled, however when using "sudo:" you must
# first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers
#
# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
# sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros).

# if True, make ansible use scp if the connection type is ssh
# (default is sftp)
